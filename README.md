#### _SQL for Data Science Capstone Project_

# **2021 Pew Research Centerâ€™s American Trends Panel:**
# **Summary of Survey Findings**

This was my final capstone project for the Coursera Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization. The final course consisted of four milestones:

* Milestone 1: Project Proposal and Data Selection/Preparation

* Milestone 2: Descriptive Stats and Understanding Your Data

* Milestone 3: Beyond Descriptive Stats (Dive Deeper/Go Broader)

* Milestone 4: Presenting Your Findings (Storytelling)

The numbered documents in this repository correspond to these milestones. I analyzed the data in a Jupyter notebook using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn. The PowerPoint presentation for Milestone 4 summarizes the survey findings and includes data visualizations.
